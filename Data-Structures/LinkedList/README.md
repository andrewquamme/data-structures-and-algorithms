# Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->


## Challenge Part 1
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within the `LinkedList class`, include a `head` property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to `head` when the linked list is instantiated.
  * Define a method called `insert` which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Define a method called `includes` which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Node�s value somewhere within the list.
  * Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
* At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

## Challenge Part 2
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* `.append(value)` which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* `.insertBefore(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* `.insertAfter(value, newVal)` which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node

You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
#### .Includes
Big O Time = O(n) // Big O Space = O(n)
#### .Insert
Big O Time = O(1) // Big O Space = O(n)
#### .Append
Big O Time = O(1) // Big O Space = O(n)
#### .InsertBefore
Big O Time = O(1) // Big O Space = O(n)
#### .InsertAfter
Big O Time = O(1) // Big O Space = O(n)
